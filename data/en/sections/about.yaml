# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a passionate software engineer with 3 years of working experience. I build tools for PaaS Cloud Computing using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) using Java and Python. My tools enable people to develop, run, and manage business applications without the need to build and maintain the infrastructure such software development processes typically require. Off work, I indulge in recreational software-development, like writing an automated responder for Facebook comments.'
